## Air Arcana Spells

### Downdraft

Requirements | Spell Type | MP Cost | Casting Time | Target Number | Test
------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----
Air Arcana (Novice) | Attack | 3 | Major Action | 10 | Dexterity (Acrobatics) vs Spellpower

Downdraft sends a column of turbulent air focused on an area 4-yards by 4-yards within 20 yards of you rushing towards the earth. Airborne creatures caught in the area of a downdraft must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test vs. your Spellpower or immediately plummet up to 40 yards straight downward, taking falling damage if the downdraft makes them hit the ground or collide with an object. Those who succeed on the Dexterity (Acrobatics) test plummet only 20 yards. Creatures already on the ground effected by this spell who fail the test are knocked prone.

Spell Type: Utility MP Cost: 2
Casting Time: Major Action Target Number: 11
Test: None

You fill your lungs with magical air that continuously satisfies your need to breathe for a number of minutes equal to your Willpower. This allows you to hold your breath to escape airborne poisons, swim for long distances underwater, or any other situation one might want to hold their breath for an extended period of time.

### Voices on the Wind

### Weapon of Air

Requirements: Air Arcana (Novice)
Spell Type: Utility MP Cost: 3
Casting Time: Major Action Target Number: 10
Test: None

You conjure a magical weapon of air that you have the weapon group for. This weapon lasts until the end of the encounter and is magically connected to your hand, making you unable to be disarmed unless you willingly let the weapon go in which case the weapon will evaporate away. The weapon acts as a normal weapon of the selected type but deals magical damage when applicable. The conjured weapon can also act as your arcane device and when using it to cast spells from the Air Arcana, treat your Spellpower as if it had a +1 bonus.

### Wind Weaving

Requirements: Air Arcana (Novice)
Spell Type: Utility MP Cost: 5
Casting Time: 1 Minute Target Number: 14
Test: None

You cause the wind to blow in whatever direction you wish, with force up to a stiff gust: strong enough to blow out candles and other small open flames, and to scatter light debris like leaves or paper. You can direct the wind for up to an hour, although changing its direction or intensity requires a major action each time you do so.
Among other things, wind weaving is used to propel sailing vessels without the need to rely on the often-fickle nature of the weather, and to calm winds that might otherwise prove disruptive.

### Cyclone Blast

Requirements: Air Arcana (Journeyman)
Spell Type: Attack MP Cost: 5-15
Casting Time: Major Action Target Number: 14
Test: Strength (Might) vs. Spellpower

You send a twisting torrent of wind towards your enemies. A cyclone blast deals 1d6 + Willpower damage per 5 MP spent with a maximum of 3d6 + Willpower damage for 15 MP to all creatures in the area. The cyclone blast begins at your fingertips and extends in a 2 yard wide line for 40 yards. Creatures in this line must succeed at a Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower or be knocked prone (larger creatures have a +2 bonus on this test while very large creatures, such as giants or dragons, take damage but are not knocked prone). Creatures that fail this test with a 1 or 2 on their Stunt die are lifted into the air by the cyclone and forcefully carried in the direction of the blast until out of range or until they hit an obstacle. At the GM’s discretion, creatures may take additional damage by hitting a wall or being pushed into some other obstacle.

### Updraft

Requirements: Air Arcana (Journeyman)
Spell Type: Attack MP Cost: 8
Casting Time: Major Action Target Number: 14
Test: Dexterity (Acrobatics) vs. Spellpower

You summon a quick burst of air just below a target within 20 yards of you. The burst forces the target upwards into the air, dealing 2d6 + Willpower piercing damage and knocking the target prone as they land. The target must succeed at a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test to land on their feet and only take 1d6 + Willpower damage. The target lands in the same space it was occupying before the spell took place.

### Wind Blast

Requirements: Air Arcana (Journeyman)
Spell Type: - MP Cost: -
Casting Time: - Target Number: -
Test: -

This spell can be found on page 69 of the Fantasy AGE Core Rulebook.

### Claws of Smoke

Requirements: Air Arcana (Master)
Spell Type: Utility MP Cost: 16
Casting Time: Minor Action Target Number: 18
Test: Constitution (Stamina) vs. Spellpower

You transform one of your hands into a smoke-like claw for a number of rounds equal to your Willpower. If you successfully attack a living creature with an Accuracy (Brawling) attack with your smoke-like claw, you forcefully fill the target’s lungs with smoke. The smoke claw inside the victim solidifies into miniature claws that rip and tear at the surrounding organs, dealing 3d6 + Willpower penetrating damage. The target can attempt a Constitution (Stamina) vs. your Spellpower test to take half damage and push your smoke out of its lungs.

If the target fails, on your next turn you may spend 16 MP to inflict another 3d6 + Willpower penetrating damage as a Major action. The target attempts another Constitution (Stamina) test in this fashion until you willingly release the target, you cannot sustain the MP cost to keep the spell active, the target succeeds on the test, or the target dies.

### Weather Weaving

Requirements: Air Arcana (Master)
Spell Type: Utility MP Cost: 8
Casting Time: 1 Hour Target Number: 16
Test: None

You shape and direct the weather in an area with a radius equal to your Intelligence in miles. You can choose any natural weather condition normally possible in the area for the given time of year (so you cannot make it snow in the middle of summer, for example, or rain in the desert). The weather forms within eight hours of your casting, so generally only limited changes are possible. You can make it warmer or colder by about 20 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degree Celsius), cause it to rain or snow (or stop doing so), or make the sky overcast or clear.

Multiple castings (and expenditures of mana) over multiple days can extend the spell’s effect, creating more dramatic shifts in the weather. Note that you do not control the weather from moment to moment. Once you have set it in motion, it follows its natural course.

### Winds of Flight

Requirements: Air Arcana (Master)
Spell Type: - MP Cost: -
Casting Time: - Target Number: -
Test: -
