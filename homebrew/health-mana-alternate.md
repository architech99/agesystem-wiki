# Alternate Health/Mana rules

I found a really cool formula for calculating health and Magic Points on the Ronin Army Forums and i have re-posted it here for other to use. the formula is simple and it does limit how much health NPCs can get as well so there is no real threat to getting OP. (FYI: i do not own the original formula, but i do condone its use. it is a great system.)

## Health

Now making a quick study, i found that a Warrior with a decent CON score can still roll poor for heath each level and soon, the Mage can get tougher than the Warrior if the Mage rolls well each level. so to eliminate this, all Classes begin with a Health Base and from there they add a +5 per Con rank and +2 per level. a Negative score in Constitution will not subtract from the health you gain, you will consider it at a 0.

Mage | Rogue | Warrior
---- | ----- | -------
20+(5xCON)+(2xLevel) | 25+(5xCON)+(2xLevel) | 30+(5xCON)+(2xLevel)
 
Some examples are:
- A Mage with a 2 Constitution at level 3: (20+(5x2)+(2x3)): 20+10+6=36 health
- A Rogue with a 2 Constitution at level 3: (25+(5x2)+(2x3)): 25+10+6=41 health
- A Warrior with a 2 Constitution at level 3: (30+(5x2)+(2x3)): 30+10+6=46 health

## Mana

Now for Magic Points i did the same cut changed the formula a tad. You begin with a base of 10 and you get a +5 per Willpower Rank and a +2 for each level. a Negative score in Willpower will not subtract from the Mana you gain, you will consider it at a 0.

Mana |
---- |
10+(5xWILL)+(2xLevel) |

Example:
- A Mage with a Willpower of 5 at level 10: (10+(5x5)+(2x10)): 10+25+20=55 Mana
