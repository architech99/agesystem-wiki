# Saurian
By Kelsey Dragonslayer

Refer to the Titansgrave Adventure Series Book (Page 20), except:

Replace the second bullet point under *Playing a Saurian* with 
- Pick one of the following ability focuses: Intelligence (Arcane Lore) or Willpower (Self-Discipline).

Replace 9 on the *Saurian Benefits* table with:
- Intelligence: (Military Lore).

Add 
- Tough Scales: Your thick hide gives you 2 natural armor. This armor stacks with worn armor, does not create an armor penalty, and doesn't cause spell strain.
