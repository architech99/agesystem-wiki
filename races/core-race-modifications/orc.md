# Orc
By Kelsey Dragonslayer

Refer to the Basic Rulebook (Page 14), except:

Add 
- Tough to Kill: Orcs are nigh impossible to keep down. If your health would drop to 0, it instead drops to 1. You may use this ability once per day.; OR
- Relentless Endurance: When you are reduced to 0 Health, you can drop to 1 Health instead on a successful TN 13 Constitution test. You canâ€™t use this feature again until you sleep.
