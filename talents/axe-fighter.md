# Axe Fighter

**Classes:** Warrior
**Requirements:** Trained in the Axes group and Strength 3 or higher.

An axe is built for chopping and destroying all that it strikes. You have learned to use its devastating power in combat.

**Novice:** You have learned to put all of your weight behind each blow with an axe. When using an All Out Attack action, do +2 damage instead of +1.

**Journeyman:** Your vicious attacks can destroy the enemy’s armor and shields. When you attack an enemy who is wearing armor or holding a shield, you can perform a special Sunder Armor stunt. For 2 SP, you can permanently reduce your opponent’s armor or shield by 1, or for 4 SP, you can permanently reduce your opponent’s armor or shield by 2. If the armor or shield is reduced to 0, it is destroyed. Magical armor and shields cannot be sundered except with magical weapons.

**Master:** You know how to hack an enemy to pieces. When rolling damage, you may reroll up to one die that comes up 1. You must take the second roll. (Note, this benefit can stack with the Two-Hander Style Master benefit if using a Two-Handed Axe. So an Axe Fighter with Two-Handed Style could roll 3d6 for damage, choose to reroll, and then reroll a single 1 if there are any. Each benefit can only be used once.)
