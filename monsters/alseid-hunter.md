# Alseid Hunter (Medium Humanoid)
By Tim Hall - Conversion from the Midgard Bestiary Vol. 1

This creature has the slender upper body of an elf and the lower body of a deer. Alseid are the graceful woodland cousins of the centaurs. Because they are rarely seen far from the wooded glades they call home, they are sometimes called "grove nymphs," despite being more closely related to elves than nymphs. Alseid see the forest as an individual and a friend. They are suspicious of outsiders who do not share this view. Lost travelers who demonstrate deep respect for the forest may spot a distant alseid's white tail and chase after it as it bounces toward a road that leads out of the forest. Disrespectful strangers may follow the same tail to their doom.
