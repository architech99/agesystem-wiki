## Welcome to the Fantasy AGE Wiki

This is the future home of the Fantasy AGE wiki. We're going to do all kinds of cool stuff with Markdown formatting and git!

Please look around! We are working hard on bringing you all the Fantasy AGE user created content we can find. We have tons and tons and tons more that has yet to be put up onto the site, but please be patient! There is so much content, and as we all have jobs during the day, there is only so much time that we can commit to building this project. If you have ideas, projects, or full blown creations of your own and wish to see them on this site for others to enjoy, please join the forum! This will be the fastest way to ensure your creations are shared with the world. All credit (at least, when we can find who to give credit to) is displayed on the page of each creation.
