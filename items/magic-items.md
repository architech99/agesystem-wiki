# Magic Items

These magic items should be used to inspire creation of other weapons or items. If the lore doesn't fit with your campaign, simply change it! The benefits that the item gives is what's important. For example, the Angry Steel weapon says that the item is a longsword, but it would be just as beneficial to rename the item Angry Steel Mace, give the same benefits, and change the description!
